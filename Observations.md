What I noticed about the original between the typescript was how I had made a new functions to accomodate the errors I was getting when compiling it. Another thing was when looking at the compiled js file instead of using ':'. It instead '===' to declare the variables types they were in typescripts. Now of course, in the original js file, it didn't use any types until it was necessary. A final thing I noticed was of course how the compiled js uses the variable declaration of 'var' instead 'let' or 'const'.
